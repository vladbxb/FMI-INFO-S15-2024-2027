Coca-Cola and Santa Claus have a special connection in holiday tradition. In the 1930s, Coca-Cola's advertising campaigns popularized the modern image of Santa Claus as a jolly, red-suited figure. Artist Haddon Sundblom created iconic illustrations of Santa enjoying a Coke, which brought warmth and joy to the brand's holiday message. Today, this association remains strong, making Coca-Cola and Santa Claus symbols of Christmas cheer worldwide.
